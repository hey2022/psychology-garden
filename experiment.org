** Text
 Is a common experimental design for comparing two treatments that uses blocks of size 2. In some {{c1::matched pairs designs}}, two very similar experimental units are paired and the two treatments are randomly assigned within each pair. In others, each experimental unit receives both treatments in a random order.

When the observed results of a study are too unusual to be explained by chance alone.
When the probability of the result occurring by chance is less than 5%.
